# Collection Data Type

Python has 4 built-in data structures that can be used to hold a collection of objects. The built-in data structures are : list, tuple, set and dictionary. They can be distinguished into mutable, immutable, set type, and mappings respectively.

# 1. List
    - List is a data structure in python that is a mutable, or changable, ordered sequence of elements.
    - Each element or value that is inside of a list called an item.
    - Lists are defined by having values between square brackets[].
    - List allows duplicate elements

# 2. Tuple
    - Tuple is a collection of objects which ordered and immutable.
    - Tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses (), separated by commas.
    - Tuple can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, list, string, etc).
    - Tuples are faster and consume less memory. 
    
# 3. Set
    - Data Set is a collection of items that are unique and unordered collection. 
    - Sets are formed with curly brackets {} and separated by commas (,).
    - Set will not allow duplicate elements
    - Set is mutable i.e we can make any changes in set. But elements are not duplicated.
    
# 4. Dictionary
   - Dictionary is a data type whose members consist of key:value pairs (key:value). 
   - Dictionary is unordered item so that its members do not have an index.
   - A dictionary is created by placing its members inside curly braces { }, separated by commas.
   - The dictionary members consist of key:value pairs. The key must be unique, there cannot be two identical keys in the dictionary.
